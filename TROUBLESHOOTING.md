## 📋 Common Issues

### Issue 1: Order not in Shopify
**Problem**: Order #1057 doesn't exist
**Solution**: Check your Shopify admin - is the order actually there?

### Issue 2: Email doesn't match
**Problem**: You entered `psaini318@gmail.com` but Shopify has `different@email.com`
**Solution**: Use the EXACT email from the debug page

### Issue 3: Phone format
**Problem**: Phone formats don't match
**Solution**: The system auto-normalizes phones, but use the exact one from debug page

### Issue 4: Typo in order number
**Problem**: You entered #1057 but it's actually #1056
**Solution**: Check the exact order number in debug page

## 🎯 Testing with Backend Logs

When you try to verify an order, check your backend terminal. You'll see:

**If order not found in Shopify:**
```
🔍 Searching for order: #1057 with contact: psaini318@gmail.com
❌ Order #1057 not found in Shopify
```

**If order found but contact doesn't match:**
```
🔍 Searching for order: #1057 with contact: psaini318@gmail.com
✅ Found order #1057 in Shopify
❌ Contact mismatch for order #1057
   Order email: different@email.com
   Order phones: +9876543210, , 
   Input contact: psaini318@gmail.com
