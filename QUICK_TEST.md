# 🚀 Quick Test Guide

## ✅ System Ready!

Your Return & Exchange system now verifies **real Shopify orders** with **phone number matching**!

## 📱 How Phone Matching Works

The system checks phone numbers from **3 different places** in your Shopify order:
1. Customer phone number
2. Billing address phone
3. Shipping address phone

**All phone formats work:**
- `+1234567890`
- `(123) 456-7890`  
- `123-456-7890`
- `1234567890`
- `+91 98765 43210`

The system removes all spaces, dashes, brackets, and plus signs for comparison!
