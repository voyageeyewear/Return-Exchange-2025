# 🔧 Fix for Order #1057 - Missing Contact Information

## ❌ The Problem

Order **#1057** exists in your Shopify store, BUT it has **NO email or phone number** attached to it!

From the backend logs:
```
✅ Found order #1057 in Shopify
❌ Contact mismatch for order #1057
   Order email: (empty)
   Order phones: (empty), (empty), (empty)
```

This means the order was created without customer contact information.

## ✅ Solution: Add Contact Info in Shopify

4. **Look for the Customer section**
5. **Click "Edit customer"** or add customer details
6. **Add the customer's email and/or phone number**
7. **Save the order**

1. Go to **Customers** in Shopify Admin
2. **Create a new customer** with:
   - Email: `psaini318@gmail.com` (or the actual email)
   - Phone: Customer's phone number
3. Go back to **Order #1057**
4. **Link this customer** to the order
5. Save

### Option 3: Use the Debug Page

Once you've added contact info to the order in Shopify:

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/admin/debug-orders
2. Find order #1057
3. You'll now see the email/phone you added
4. Copy those exact values
5. Test again!

## 💡 Alternative: Use a Different Order

If you can't edit order #1057, try testing with a different order that has contact information:

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/admin/debug-orders
2. Find an order that shows email and/or phone
3. Use that order number and contact info to test
